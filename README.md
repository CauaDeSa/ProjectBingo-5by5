Let's develop a game?

Simple, a bingo game.

The bingo rules are as follows:

  The cards have 25 numbers written in random order.
  The drawn numbers range from 1 to 99.
  If any player completes a line, the score for all of them becomes valid only for the column of any card and vice versa.
  From then on, only the full card score counts.
  The draws must take place until a player completes the card (BINGO!).

There are 3 possible points:

  Upon completing a line, the player receives 1 point.
  Upon completing a column, the player receives 1 point.
  Upon completing the card, the player receives 5 points.

You will need to control the draw, where no repeated numbers can happen, and also control the cards, where each card must have marked the drawn numbers to check the completion of the row/column/card to count the points.

At the end of the game, it should be shown who the winning players were and the score of each one.

Optional Features:

  Each player can have more than one card.
  The game must be able to be played by more than 2 players, where the user informs at the beginning of the program the amount of players he wants.
